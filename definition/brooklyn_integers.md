# Brooklyn Integers

Brooklyn Integers is an independently owned and operated integer-as-a-service provider. All integers are hand-crafted and guaranteed to be unique and hella-beautiful. For example: _[85688637](https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/spelunker/id/85688637)_.

Each Who's On First record is assigned a unique identifier (or `wof:id`), derived from Brooklyn Integers. Rather than running our own unique ID service, we hold hands with the Brooklyn Integers service.
